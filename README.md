# HTN-Project - Scribbly

## Overview
Project submission for Hack the North 2021. Scribbly is an Arduino based robot that takes in an image and draws it out on the ground in real life!
Serial communication between Python code and Arduino has not been implemented yet, so import the coordinates from the python code and input it into the Arduino code.
More information can be found on the project [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/drawing-bot-pz5bfc).

### Arduino
The arduino code requires the servo library from Keyestudio found in the Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yfip8hquyfmi54m/AABiWhMX0TiZnUiSaz4hs9-Ka/3.%20Tutorial%20-Arduino/2.%20Libraries).
Download and extract the zip folder, then place the extracted folder in your Arduino libraries folder
